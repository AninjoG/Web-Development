    <h2><b>Google Founded</b></h2>
    <div class="author">- Aninjo George</div>
    <p> The search engine Google is incorporated as a private company 
        in Menlo Park, California by Larry Page and Sergey Brin during September.
        Page and Brin were still Ph.D students at Stanford University and had previously 
        created the website as a research project starting in 1996. The company grew rapidly 
        and received investments early on from the co-founder of Sun Microsystems and the founder of Amazon. </p>

    <p>It was successful due to its unique algorithm that calculated a website’s relevance to a search by analyzing 
        links back to the site rather than connections to the search terms, producing higher quality results.</p>

    <p>While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page,
        they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.They called this algorithm PageRank; 
        it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.
        Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.</p>

    <p>Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site</p>

    <h2><b>Prince Charles and Diana Divorce</b></h2>
      <p>Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales get divorced.</p>
      <p>More Information for Charles and Diana</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Princess Diana and Prince Charles are officially divorced during August of 1996.</li>
        <li>The couple had married in 1981 as the world watched the extravagant event.</li>
        <li>In 1982 they had their first son Prince William and in 1984 their second son, Prince Harry, was born.</li>
        <li> Their early marriage had been painted as a fairy tale but it was also highly dissected in the public eye and the pair were often featured in tabloids.</li>
        <li>By 1992 the couple had grown apart and were officially separated.</li>
        <li>Eventually Diana and Charles agreed to settlement terms and at the urging of Queen Elizabeth II they were officially divorced.</li>
        <li>Diana was stripped of the title “Her Royal Highness” as a result of the divorce but was allowed to keep the name Diana, Princess of Wales.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After initial resistance, Diana says she will agree to a divorce. 
        "It was an exceptionally difficult decision and one which the Princess of Wales has 
        taken with immense sadness and regret," her lawyer said in an interview with the BBC.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was agreed that Diana would continue to live at Kensington Palace and would be known as Diana,
        Princess of Wales but not Her Royal Highness. Her settlement was rumored to be worth £15 million.
        In regards to custody, Charles and Diana reportedly spilt custody between Prince Harry and Prince William.
        However, this was the norm when the couple separated, and the two sons were attending boarding school at the time.
